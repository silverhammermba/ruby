== Changes since the 1.9.3 release

=== C API updates
* NUM2SHORT() and NUM2USHORT() added. They are similar to NUM2INT, but short.

* builtin classes

  * Kernel
    * extended method:
      * Kernel#warn accepts multiple args in like puts.
    * incompatible changes:
      * system() and exec() closes non-standard file descriptors
        (The default of :close_others option is changed to true by default.)
      * respond_to? against a protected method now returns false unless
        the second argument is true.

  * Signal
    * incompatible changes:
      * Signal.trap raises ArgumentError when :SEGV, :BUS, :ILL, :FPE, :VTALRM
        are specified.

  * Time
    * change return value:
      * Time#to_s returned encoding defaults to US-ASCII but automatically
        transcodes to Encoding.default_internal if it is set.

  * Fiber
    * incompatible changes:
      * Fiber#resume cannot resume a fiber which invokes "Fiber#transfer".

    * Net::IMAP.default_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_imap_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_tls_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_ssl_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_imaps_port

* pathname
  * extended method:
    * Pathname#find returns an enumerator if no block is given.

* resolv
  * new methods:
    * Resolv::DNS#timeouts=
    * Resolv::DNS::Config#timeouts=

* shellwords
    * Shellwords#shellescape() now stringifies the given object using to_s.
    * Shellwords#shelljoin() accepts non-string objects in the given
      array, each of which is stringified using to_s.

  * incompatible changes:
    The :close_others option is true by default for system() and exec().
    Also, the close-on-exec flag is set by default for all new file descriptors.
    This means file descriptors doesn't inherit to spawned process unless
    explicitly requested such as system(..., fd=>fd).

  * Kernel#respond_to? against a protected method now returns false
    unless the second argument is true.
